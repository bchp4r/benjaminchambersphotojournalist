<p>New York City is experiencing its largest and longest job expansion since the end of World War II. The City added 820,400 jobs between 2009 and 2018, more than every state in the nation outside of California, Texas, Florida, and of course New York. However, most of the jobs were in employment subsectors with average salaries below the citywide average.<br>
	<br>
The current job expansion is also the fastest, with an average of 91,200 jobs added each year. Preliminary data from the New York State Department of Labor suggested that the pace of job growth had slowed in 2018, but revised data show that growth remained strong. A total of 86,600 jobs were added, on par with gains in the two prior years.<br>
<br>
New York City has been the driving force behind employment gains in New York State. Job growth in the City has outpaced the State (and the nation) every year since the end of the recession. Although the City accounted for less than half of the jobs in the State in 2009, it was responsible for more than two- thirds of the statewide job gains since then.<br>
<br>
Business services, leisure and hospitality, and health care accounted for 60 percent of the job gains since 2009. Although the high- paying securities industry has reported solid job gains in recent years, it is still 4 percent smaller than before the 2007 financial crisis, while employment in the rest of the private sector has grown by 25 percent.<br>
<br>
New York City has become less dependent on the securities industry for economic growth. Other industries such as tourism, tech, health care and business services are driving job growth and reducing the unemployment rate to record lows. While job growth remains strong in New York City, there are national and global economic risks that could affect the pace of future growth.</p><br>

<b>Highlights</b><br>
<br>
<p>According to the MTA, Additional Platform Time (APT) refers to “The estimated average time that customers spend waiting at a station beyond their scheduled wait time.” In September 2019, the 7 train was classified by the MTA as the best train service with 96% on time service. This was after having had one of the worst months in August 2019, when commuters clocked in APT of 2.44 minutes during peak hours and 1.07 during off-peak hours. In September 2019, however, APT on the 7 train was .70, which beat the .76 APT of the W train, MTA’s best train.<br>
	<br>
Queens residents should be encouraged, because the average APT of the 7 train has declined by 17% since 2018 and has continued to decline month over month in 2019, although exceptions may randomly occur.<br>

			<img src="images/burning5.png">	  After five years of photographing this unique community, I have come to understand the concept of radical inclusion, all are welcome and accepted at Black Rock. In the world of "Burning Man" I observed and captured colorful citizens, loving and open people, sunrises, sunsets, landscapes natural and man-made, all presenting an alternative world, an experiment free of religious ties, bureaucratic border patrols, political barriers, conspicuous consumerism, where all are welcome. It is a world in which we are each different, but interdependent, where we need much less than what we have to survive with dignity. Black Rock offers a refuge, an awakening in which we can educate, dance, create and be happy without losing sight of what really matters, life in freedom with others.</div></div> -->
